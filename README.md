# Solidity_Assignment3

Problem1:DistributedCabService(mandatory)   
Make a solidity smart contract application through which customers can ask for cabs and cab drivers can
respond to their requests. Customers can provide their source and destination address to the contract so
that the drivers can decide whether to entertain the request or not. Let there be an auction among the
drivers through which the smart contract will decide which driver to allocate the customer. The auction will
be on the rates provided by the drivers for a particular ride. Once the driver is confirmed, the contract should
broadcast this result. You are at liberty to decide the auction rules and type.
Problem2:SimultaneousTic-Tac-Toe   
Make a two player game usingsolidity smart contracts where the players play tic-tac-toe on a 3x3 grid. There
is a catch though, instead of players playing sequentially, here players will play their moves simultaneously.
Like the solidity assignments before, please keep in mind all the security issues. Please keep in mind that
your smart contract should offer at least these basic features. Anythingextra is left towards your creativity.  
  
Features:  
print the matrix  
take players move  
keep each player's move private from the other player until both have played their moves  
broadcast the updated grid after both players have played their moves  
Problem3:ReverseAverageAuction   
In this auction, the agents provide their costs to complete a particular task. The beneficiary takes all the
input costs and choses the agent whose cost is closest to the average. You can refer to the Simple Auction
and Blind Auction given on solidity documentation to understand the dynamics of auction contracts. Note:
Reverse Auction is many a times used by Government agencies to distribute resources to the private
companies.  

Note: It is mandatory to do the first problem statement. You can choose 1 of the 2 other problems as the
other problem. Also, you are free to code all three problems, if your other 2 implementations are not good
enough, the third code can cover for them.
